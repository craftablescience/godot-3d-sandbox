# 3D Sandbox
#### [Play the game here!](https://craftablescience.github.io/godot-3d-sandbox/html5/ "Click Me")

This repository is a game inspired by Garry's Mod. It's basically a testing grounds for my game mechanics ideas, and anything I want to make.
Feel free to request features, or add them yourself if you get impatient :D

All assets are original, except for the HDRI skybox (taken from https://hdrihaven.com/).
